To check out videos and download files, I uploaded in my Google Drive, visit [OmniStack 11](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nEpuOaWbiNk1D4a7hsJ062_H5w4zAqiD?usp=sharing).

## How to Start

First you need to [clone](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) or [fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) the repository.

With the code in your machine, you'll open the terminal and will install all dependencies.

``` npm i ```

After that you'll start the expo.

``` npm start ```

Now all is working. Congratulations!
